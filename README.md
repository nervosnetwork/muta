## Compile and Run

The first step to compile muta is to install rust. Generally speaking, you'll need an Internet connection to run the commands in this section, as we'll be downloading Rust from the Internet.

```shell
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

You can get more infomation from [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

And the next step, also the only step:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/nervosnetwork/muta.git
$ cd muta
$ cargo run -- init
```

If everything goes well, youâ€™ll see this appear:

```
[2019-09-25T15:26:14Z INFO  muta] Go with config: Config { .. }
```

The develop chain is worked on **LOCAL** and **SINGLE NODE**.
