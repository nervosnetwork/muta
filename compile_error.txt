I have found out an error below when compiling codes here:
"""
error: failed to select a version for the requirement `zeroize = "^0.9.3"`

perhaps a crate was updated and forgotten to be re-vendored?

Maybe there is something wrong with the dependencies the repo use, please check out and fix it.

PS: The repo needs to update the version of Rust , current version of Rust stable is 1.53.0 .
Thank you
